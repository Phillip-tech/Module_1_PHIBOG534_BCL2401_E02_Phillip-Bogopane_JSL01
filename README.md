# Module_02_PHIBOG534_BCL2401_E02_Phillip-Bogopane_JSL02

### Overview

The provided code snippet defines a JavaScript function validateSyntax that validates the syntax of a pet adoption code entered by the user. It checks if the input matches the pattern 'pet_' followed by alphanumeric characters and updates the displayed result message with the corresponding color (green for valid syntax and red for invalid syntax).
